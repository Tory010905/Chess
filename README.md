# Chess

Simple game of chess written in the best game engine that exists, microsoft winforms...

This was my first big project that I did as my final work for my highschool IT class in 2020. I had basically no experience when I started with it. 
I jumped into it and just went with what worked, had no idea how things should be done,
but I had vision and made it work.

# Implemented mechanics

Game supports all legal chess moves including castling, upgrading pawns, checks and en passant.

Also has turn tracker, undo move button and reset button.
